# RotaryPlotterFinal

This project comprises the code to opperate a rotary plotter, akin to an X-Y Plotter, designed from scratch, for fun. The basic electronic components of the code include the following:

Rasberry Pi (Running Processing 3.0.1)
Arduino Uno (Connected to the Rasberry Pi via serial; communication via Processing)
2x FEMA 17 Stepper Motors (Driven by EasyDriver stepper motor drivers)
1x Servo Motor
To be functional, the project should include 2 code components (Processing Code/Python; Arduino Code) along with the various STL 3D Printed files. There will also be various test images and files as needed.

The Project will take input from a webcam, process it, and print it.
